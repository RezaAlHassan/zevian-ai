Guided Tour: A brief, non-dismissible tour highlights:

Submit Report Page: Focus on the Rich Text Editor and the "Preview Evaluation" button.

Dashboard: Where they will see their objective scores and AI-generated coaching.

First Action: The employee is immediately prompted to submit their first report based on the newly created goal. This fulfills the FS-1 User Story.
