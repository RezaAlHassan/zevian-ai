1. The Core Principle: Manager ScopeWe define the Manager's scope using three simple, intuitive tiers:
ScopeDefinition (How the System Filters)Manager Type/RoleDirectReports only from employees whose manager_id is the current user.
Default Manager (or a Limited Manager 2)Full ChainReports from all employees who report to the current manager, 
or to any manager below them in the hierarchy.Senior Manager / Account Owner (Anyone with canViewOrganizationWide access 3333)
OrganizationAll employees in the system, regardless of reporting line.Account Owner (Always 4)2. 
Implementation Flow (Manager Assignment)The Account Owner implements the hierarchy and delegates oversight in a single, 
simple action: reassigning a manager to report to a superior manager.StepAction by Account Owner/Superior ManagerImplementation
 Detail1. Create the ManagerInvite the user as a Manager (Role). 5555Uses the Invite User Modal flow. 
 62. Establish HierarchyOn the Employee Detail Page 7 of the new Manager (e.g., 'Junior Manager'), 
 set their manager_id to the superior manager (e.g., 'Senior Manager').This is a simple update to the Employees 
 data model manager_id field. 8888888883. Manager Experience: Dashboard & ReportsThis is where the simplicity pays off.
  We modify the existing Frequency Scope Toggle 9999on the Settings Page and the Search Scope 10on the Dashboard 
  11111111 to implicitly handle the new hierarchy.A. Central Scope SelectorOn the Dashboard and All Reports Page, we 
  introduce a single, high-level selector (if the user has the necessary organizational permissions 12):Scope: 
  [My Teams] | [My Reporting Chain] | [All Organization]If the Manager is delegated as a "Senior Manager" 
  (i.e., they have subordinate managers):Clicking "My Reporting Chain" 13 automatically includes all reports from their direct team AND all reports from teams managed by the junior managers below them, using a recursive query on the manager_id data.B. Delegating Account ControlThe ability to "give account control to managers they want" 14is best handled in the Settings Module 15 by the Account Owner only.Permission Tiers: The Account Owner (or a delegated Manager with the canManageSettings permission 161616) uses the Permission Management feature on the Settings Page171717.Toggle Permissions: The Owner simply toggles a Manager's role between Manager (Limited) and Manager (Full)18.Manager (Full): Has the delegated "account control" (e.g., can override AI scores 191919, manage all settings 20).
Manager (Limited): Can only view their team and submit reports21.This simplified approach is easier to build, easier to use, and aligns perfectly with standard enterprise software architecture.
Suboprdniate selection and reporting chain can be establshed in the employee detail page or in a seperate tab in teh setings (move user oermissions section in seyyings tegre as well)
